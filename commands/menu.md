Display the quick command menu.

```bash
echo "=== Quick Commands ==="
echo ""
echo "  /cost-report     View token usage and cost"
echo "  /index-project   Build search index for project"
echo "  /summarize       Create session summary"
echo ""
```

That's it - just show these 3 commands. Don't add any others or run status checks.
